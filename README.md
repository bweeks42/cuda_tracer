# CUDA Tracer
This is a toy tracer written in the CUDA programming language. It is a rewrite of a similar ray tracer I wrote in Rust, which in turn was based on the popular series "Ray Tracing in One Weekend". 

As this is my first CUDA project and was mostly exploratory, the code has not been profiled or tested beyond producing images.
